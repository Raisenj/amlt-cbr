This project was implemented in Python.

The project contains a list of python files that are encapsulating objects and functions. The main file is CBR.py, which is the one that manages the workfloy by using such functions resulting in a CBR tool.

In this case, we used a shell-command interface because is quicker and is not in the scope of the project to design a nice GUI. However, the project is structured in such a way that a GUI could be programmed without implementing any CBR-domain specific function.

EXECUTION

In order to execute the CBR just type "python CBR.py" in a shell (check the documentation for more information).
